# Metis

Metis is a web/mobile app providing visual tools that empower you to work through decision-making, conflict resolution, and planning on your own terms. Named after the Greek goddess Metis, the app offers frameworks and methods that help you develop your own practical solutions to complex issues.

Automated live preview of the main branch can be found at https://nilsherzig.github.io/metis/.

## Project Goals

The core goals of Metis are:

1. **Clarify Complexity**: Break down problems, decisions, and conflicts into visual maps and diagrams like issue trees, diagramming methods, and matrices. These tools enable you to organize your own thinking and information.

2. **Support Better Choices**: Learn to use visual frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks, evaluate options, and make decisions that align with your principles - not by having choices made for you.

3. **Help Address Conflicts**: Master diagramming techniques to map different perspectives in a conflict, discover root causes yourself, and work toward reasonable resolutions through your own understanding.

4. **Assist with Planning**: Leverage structured methods to outline your own plans, think through scenarios independently, and prepare personalized approaches to challenges.

5. **Aid Personal Growth**: The tools aim to strengthen your own practical judgment, foresight, and problem-solving capabilities through active practice.

Metis provides helpful visualization tools and methods for approaching complex situations. Like its mythological namesake, the app strives to be a catalyst for developing your own wisdom and solutions.
